title: COSMOS Spectroscopic Redshift Compilation
caption: I am leading a compilation of all published spectroscopic redshifts in the COSMOS field. This has legacy value for the community as such compilations can be used for a multitude of reasons from photo-$$z$$ calibrations and contamination assessments to follow-up studies with other facilities. The compilation will be made public when the survey paper (led by me) is published (expected 2024).
description: >
  An example of how the spec-$$z$$ compilation can be used to visualize large-scale structure in 3D. *Left:* The large $$ z \sim 2.45 $$ overdensity ``Hyperion" ([Cucciati et al. (2018)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...619A..49C/abstract)) is found to be within $$\sim 50$$ cMpc two other overdense regions. *Right* The $$ z \sim 0.84 $$ overdensity identified in [Sobral et al. 2011](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.411..675S/abstract) and studied extensively with VIMOS ([Paulino-Afonso et al. 2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...620A.186P/abstract)). Visualizing it in 3D shows an elongated structure along the line-of-sight.

I am leading the COSMOS spec-z compilation: a collection of all “published” spectroscopic redshifts. This is a collaborative effort between myself, Olivier Ilbert (LAM), Mara Salvato (MPE; who led past versions of the compilation), Jeyhan Kartaltepe (RIT), and Caitlin Casey (UT Austin). Olivier and I developed a compilation pipeline that gathers all published COSMOS spectroscopic studies and organizes them in a concise, uniform manner (e.g., quality flags, astrometric corrections). This is a large undertaking that involves mining databases, survey papers/websites, and community outreach. The infrastructure is highly efficient where new redshifts can easily be imported. A total of 164134 redshifts and 96934 unique 0 < z < 9 galaxies makeup the full catalog. I am currently leading the paper documenting the compilation (expected 2024). One key feature that comes from the compilation is visualizing 3D large-scale structure using spectro- scopic redshifts (shown above) which provides a different perspective of overdense region shapes. The compilation and archive can be used in future works for calibrating photometric redshifts, measuring contamination fractions, and follow-up samples with next-gen facilities (including *JWST*). I am the main contact for this compilation answering any questions by the community. More to follow as the paper is written and published.

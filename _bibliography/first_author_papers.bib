      abstract = {The H$\alpha$~equivalent width (EW) is an observational proxy for specific star formation rate (sSFR) and a tracer of episodic, bursty star-formation activity. Previous assessments show that the H$\alpha$~EW strongly anticorrelates with stellar mass as $M^{-0.25}$ similar to the sSFR - stellar mass relation. However, such a correlation could be driven or even formed by selection effects. In this study, we investigate how H α EW distributions correlate with physical properties of galaxies and how selection biases could alter such correlations using a $z = 0.47$~narrow-band-selected sample of 1572 H$\alpha$~emitters from the Ly$\alpha$~Galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization (LAGER) survey as our observational case study. The sample covers a 3 deg$^2$~area of COSMOS with a survey comoving volume of $1.1\times10^5$~Mpc$^3$. We assume an intrinsic EW distribution to form mock samples of H$\alpha$~emitters and propagate the selection criteria to match observations, giving us control on how selection biases can affect the underlying results. We find that H$\alpha$~EW intrinsically correlates with stellar mass as $W_0 \propto M^{-0.16\pm0.03}$~and decreases by a factor of $\sim$3 from 10$^7$~M$_\odot$~to 10$^{10}$~M$_\odot$, while not correcting for selection effects steepens the correlation as $M^{-0.25\pm0.04}. We find low-mass H$\alpha$~emitters to be $\sim320$ times more likely to have rest-frame EW$>200$~\AA compared to high-mass H$\alpha$~emitters. Combining the intrinsic $W_0$-stellar mass correlation with an observed stellar mass function correctly reproduces the observed H$\alpha$~luminosity function, while not correcting for selection effects underestimates the number of bright emitters. This suggests that the $W_0$-stellar mass correlation when corrected for selection effects is physically significant and reproduces three statistical distributions of galaxy populations (line luminosity function, stellar mass function, EW distribution). At lower stellar masses, we find there are more high-EW outliers compared to high stellar masses, even after we take into account selection effects. Our results suggest that high sSFR outliers indicative of bursty star formation activity are intrinsically more prevalent in low-mass H$\alpha$~emitters and not a byproduct of selection effects.}

Our observations reach 5σ depths of 8.2 × 10-18 erg s-1 cm-2 and comoving volumes of (1-7) × 105 Mpc3 making our survey one of the deepest narrow-band surveys. We select our emission line galaxies via spectroscopic confirmation, photometric redshifts, and colour-colour selections. We measure the observed luminosity functions for each sample and find best fits of φ ^\star = 10^{-3.16^{+0.09}_{-0.09}} Mpc-3 and L^\star = 10^{41.72^{+0.09}_{-0.09}} erg s-1 for H α, φ ^\star = 10^{-2.16^{+0.10}_{-0.12}} Mpc-3 and L^\star = 10^{41.38^{+0.07}_{-0.06}} erg s-1 for [O III], and φ ^\star = 10^{-1.97^{+0.07}_{-0.07}} Mpc-3 and L^\star = 10^{41.66^{+0.03}_{-0.03}} erg s-1 for [O II], with α fixed to -1.75, -1.6, and -1.3, respectively. An excess of bright >1042 erg s-1 [O III] emitters is observed and may be due to active galactic nucleus (AGN) contamination. Corrections for dust attenuation are applied assuming AHα = 1 mag. We also design our own empirical rest-frame g - r calibration using SDSS DR12 data, test it against our z = 0.47 H α emitters with zCOSMOS 1D spectra, and calibrate it for (g - r) between -0.8 and 1.3 mag. Dust and AGN-corrected star formation rate densities (SFRDs) are measured as log10ρSFR/(M⊙ yr-1 Mpc-3) = -1.63 ± 0.04, -1.07 ± 0.06, and -0.90 ± 0.10 for H α, [O III], and [O II], respectively. We find our [O III] and [O II] samples fully trace cosmic star formation activity at their respective redshifts in comparison to multiwavelength SFRDs, while the H α sample traces ∼70 per cent of the total z = 0.47 SFRD.}

We measure clustering lengths of r0 ∼ 3-6 h-1 Mpc and typical halo masses of ∼1011 M⊙ for our narrowband-selected LAEs with typical LLy α ∼ 1042-43 erg s-1. The intermediate-band-selected LAEs are observed to have r0 ∼ 3.5-15 h-1 Mpc with typical halo masses of ∼1011-12 M⊙ and typical LLy α ∼ 1043-43.6 erg s-1. We find a strong, redshift-independent correlation between halo mass and Ly α luminosity normalized by the characteristic Ly α luminosity, L⋆(z). The faintest LAEs (L ∼ 0.1 L⋆(z)) typically identified by deep narrowband surveys are found in 1010 M⊙ haloes and the brightest LAEs (L ∼ 7 L⋆(z)) are found in ∼5 × 1012 M⊙ haloes. A dependency on the rest-frame 1500 Å UV luminosity, MUV, is also observed where the halo masses increase from 1011 to 1013 M⊙ for MUV ∼ -19 to -23.5 mag. Halo mass is also observed to increase from 109.8 to 1012 M⊙ for dust-corrected UV star formation rates from ∼0.6 to 10 M⊙ yr-1 and continues to increase up to 1013 M⊙ in halo mass, where the majority of those sources are active galactic nuclei. All the trends we observe are found to be redshift independent. Our results reveal that LAEs are the likely progenitors of a wide range of galaxies depending on their luminosity, from dwarf-like, to Milky Way-type, to bright cluster galaxies. LAEs therefore provide unique insight into the early formation and evolution of the galaxies we observe in the local Universe.}

We find r0 to strongly increase both with increasing line luminosity and redshift. By taking into account the evolution of the characteristic line luminosity, L⋆(z), and using our model predictions of halo mass given r0, we find a strong, redshift-independent increasing trend between L/L⋆(z) and minimum halo mass. The faintest H β + [O III] emitters are found to reside in 109.5 M⊙ haloes and the brightest emitters in 1013.0 M⊙ haloes. For [O II] emitters, the faintest emitters are found in 1010.5 M⊙ haloes and the brightest emitters in 1012.6 M⊙ haloes. A redshift-independent stellar mass dependency is also observed where the halo mass increases from 1011 to 1012.5 M⊙ for stellar masses of 108.5 to 1011.5 M⊙, respectively. We investigate the interdependencies of these trends by repeating our analysis in a Lline-Mstar grid space for our most populated samples (H β + [O III] z = 0.84 and [O II] z = 1.47) and find that the line luminosity dependency is stronger than the stellar mass dependency on halo mass. For L > L⋆ emitters at all epochs, we find a relatively flat trend with halo masses of 1012.5-13 M⊙, which may be due to quenching mechanisms in massive haloes that is consistent with a transitional halo mass predicted by models.}

We measure the Hβ+[O III]-selected stellar mass functions out to z ∼ 3.5 and find that both M⋆ and φ⋆ increases with cosmic time. The [O II]-selected stellar mass functions show a constant M⋆ ≈ 1011.6 M⊙ and a strong, increasing evolution with cosmic time in φ⋆ in line with Hα studies. We also investigate the evolution of the EWrest as a function of redshift with a fixed mass range (109.5-10.0 M⊙) and find an increasing trend best represented by (1 + z)3.81 ± 0.14 and (1 + z)2.72 ± 0.19 up to z ∼ 2 and ∼3 for Hβ+[O III] and [O II] emitters, respectively. This is the first time that the EWrest evolution has been directly measured for Hβ+[O III] and [O II] emitters up to these redshifts. There is evidence for a slower evolution for z > 2 in the Hβ+[O III] EWrest and a decreasing trend for z > 3 in the [O II] EWrest evolution, which would imply low [O II] EW at the highest redshifts and higher [O III]/[O II] line ratios. This suggests that the ionization parameter at higher redshift may be significantly higher than the local Universe. Our results set the stage for future near-IR space-based spectroscopic surveys to test our extrapolated predictions and also produce z > 5 measurements to constrain the high-z end of the EWrest and [O III]/[O II] evolution.}

This is the first time that the H β + [O III] and [O II] luminosity functions have been studied at these redshifts in a self-consistent analysis. This is also the largest sample of [O II] and H β + [O III] emitters (3475 and 3298 emitters, respectively) in this redshift range, with large comoving volumes ∼1 × 106 Mpc-3 in two independent volumes (COSMOS and UDS), greatly reducing the effects of cosmic variance. The emitters were selected by a combination of photometric redshift and colour-colour selections, as well as spectroscopic follow-up, including recent spectroscopic observations using DEIMOS and MOSFIRE on the Keck Telescopes and FMOS on Subaru. We find a strong increase in L⋆ and a decrease in φ⋆ for both H β + [O III] and [O II] emitters. We derive the [O II] star formation history of the Universe since z ∼ 5 and find that the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD) rises from z ∼ 5 to ∼3 and then drops towards z ∼ 0. We also find that our star formation history is able to reproduce the evolution of the stellar mass density up to z ∼ 5 based only on a single tracer of star formation. When comparing the H β + [O III] SFRDs to the [O II] and H α SFRD measurements in the literature, we find that there is a remarkable agreement, suggesting that the H β + [O III] sample is dominated by star-forming galaxies at high-z rather than AGNs.}

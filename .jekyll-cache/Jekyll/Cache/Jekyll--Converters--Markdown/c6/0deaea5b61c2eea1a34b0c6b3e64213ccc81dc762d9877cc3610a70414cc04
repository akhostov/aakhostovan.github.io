I"Ò<p>I am from South San Francisco, CA and earned my degrees from the University of California, Irvine (Bachelors in Physics) and University of California, Riverside (Masters and PhD in Physics). I was also a NESSF PhD fellow my last 2 years at UC Riverside and went on to be a NASA Postdoctoral Program Fellow at Goddard Space Flight Center as my first postdoc position. I am currently  a Postdoctoral Research Associate at RIT. My work primarily focuses on studying galaxy evolution, especially extreme emission line galaxies, using narrowband surveys, spectroscopic follow-ups, and broadband color excess. I am interested in studying how star formation activity occured in galaxies, what factors influenced said activity, and map out the evolutionary path to present-day galaxies. My work also involves creating and managing the COSMOS spectroscopic archive and spec-\(z\) compilation. <strong>Below is a brief version of my full CV which can be downloaded by clicking the ‚ÄúFull CV‚Äù button.</strong></p>

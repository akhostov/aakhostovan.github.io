I"—<p>An example of how the spec-\(z\) compilation can be used to visualize large-scale structure in 3D. <em>Left:</em> The large \(z \sim 2.45\) overdensity ``Hyperion‚Äù (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...619A..49C/abstract">Cucciati et al. (2018)</a>) is found to be within \(\sim 50\) cMpc two other overdense regions. <em>Right</em> The \(z \sim 0.84\) overdensity identified in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.411..675S/abstract">Sobral et al. 2011</a> and studied extensively with VIMOS (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...620A.186P/abstract">Paulino-Afonso et al. 2018</a>). Visualizing it in 3D shows an elongated structure along the line-of-sight.</p>

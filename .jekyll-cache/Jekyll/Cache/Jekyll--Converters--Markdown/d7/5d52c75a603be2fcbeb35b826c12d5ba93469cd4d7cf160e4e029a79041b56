I"ì<p>I am an extragalactic astronomer working primarily on the observational side. I was born in San Francisco but moved to South San Francisco when I was just 1 year old and was raised there till I went off to University. I attended UC Irvine from 2008 to 2012 for my undergraduate studies in astrophysics and spent all four years working with Asantha Cooray and his research group. I then moved up an hour drive north to UC Riverside where I pursued my PhD studies from 2012 to 2018 under the supervision of Bahram Mobasher and David Sobral (University of Lisbon; later Lancaster University). During my PhD studies, I was in a unique position where I got to travel ~ 2 times a year to Portugal (later England) for weeks at a time to work with David Sobral on my projects and also give talks at various venues in Europe. I was a NASA Earth &amp; Space Sciences Fellow (2016 - 2018; now called FINESST) which funded my last 2 years as a PhD student and supported my research trips to Europe. After receiving my PhD, I left California for Maryland where I began my first postdoctoral position as a NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) Fellow from 2018 - 2021 working with Sangeeta Malhotra and James Rhoads on the LAGER narrowband survey. After my fellowship ended, I began working with Jeyhan Kartaltepe (RIT) as a Postdoctoral Research Associate from 2021 to the present on various projects related to a large, public COSMOS spectroscopic archive and JWST studies. During this time, I married the love of my life, Zahra ‚ÄúSusan‚Äù Zarejousheghani in 2022 and we have been happily living in Maryland as I work remotely for RIT and she pursues her PhD studies in Computational Biology.</p>

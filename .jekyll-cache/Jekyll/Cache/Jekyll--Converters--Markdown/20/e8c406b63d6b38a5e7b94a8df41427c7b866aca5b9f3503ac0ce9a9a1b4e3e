I"ì<p>I led several projects under the supervision of Sangeeta Malhotra and James Rhoads on investigating emission line galaxies with large narrowband surveys. The pivotal moment of this position was creating a forward modeling approach in constraining the intrinsic equivalent width distributions of galaxy populations and highlighting how this approach can be used to infer the relative contribution of high EW emitters to total cosmic star formation activity at any constrained redshift.</p>

I""<p>I have been part of several outreach programs over the years. I strongly believe that public outreach is something that should be included as part of any astronomer’s life. What good is the knowledge that we learn from our hard-work investigations when we don’t share it with the general public. More importantly, I see public outreach as an opportunity to make people not just educated on what we do, but also spark that motivation/curiosity in people’s mind to appreaciate and/or pursue STEM. I hope that during these many years I inspired some to explore a life in STEM: be it in academia or industry. Below are the various outreach programs that I have been involved with.

I"_<p>I am leading a study using COSMOS-Web <em>JWST</em>/NIRCam imaging to investigate EELGs at \(z \sim 6.7 - 9\) identified by F444W nebular excess with the main goal being to understand the nature of `extreme’ systems in the context of rapid galaxy growth and  Reionization. This is an ongoing work; however, we have identified several interesting sourcs such as the one shown above with extremely high [OIII]+Hβ equivalent widths and low stellar masses suggesting these could be some of the most extreme EELGs. Work is currently underway so stay tuned for more and a paper highlighting the sample!</p>

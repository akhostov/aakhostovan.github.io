I"Í<p>I led studies on galaxy - galaxy clustering of emission line selected galaxies up to \(z \sim 6\) finding a strong, redshift-independent correlation between host halo mass and emission line luminosity independent of line selection with evidence of a transitional halo mass at \(L &gt; L^\star\). This highlights the important role that host halos could have in regulating cold gas accretion resulting in star formation and strong nebular emission lines.</p>

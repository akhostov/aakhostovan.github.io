I"~<p>I am leading the COSMOS spec-z compilation: a collection of all “published” spectroscopic redshifts. This is a collaborative effort between myself, Olivier Ilbert (LAM), Mara Salvato (MPE; who led past versions of the compilation), Jeyhan Kartaltepe (RIT), and Caitlin Casey (UT Austin). Olivier and I developed a compilation pipeline that gathers all published COSMOS spectroscopic studies and organizes them in a concise, uniform manner (e.g., quality flags, astrometric corrections). This is a large undertaking that involves mining databases, survey papers/websites, and community outreach. The infrastructure is highly efficient where new redshifts can easily be imported. A total of 164134 redshifts and 96934 unique 0 &lt; z &lt; 9 galaxies makeup the full catalog. I am currently leading the paper documenting the compilation (expected 2024). One key feature that comes from the compilation is visualizing 3D large-scale structure using spectro- scopic redshifts (shown above) which provides a different perspective of overdense region shapes. The compilation and archive can be used in future works for calibrating photometric redshifts, measuring contamination fractions, and follow-up samples with next-gen facilities (including <em>JWST</em>). I am the main contact for this compilation answering any questions by the community. More to follow as the paper is written and published.</p>

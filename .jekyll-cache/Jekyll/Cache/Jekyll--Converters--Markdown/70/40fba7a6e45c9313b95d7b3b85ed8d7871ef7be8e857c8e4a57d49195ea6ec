I"ê<p>I am leading a compilation of all published spectroscopic redshifts in the COSMOS field. This has legacy value for the community as such compilations can be used for a multitude of reasons from photo-\(z\) calibrations and contamination assessments to follow-up studies with other facilities. The compilation will be made public when the survey paper (led by me) is published (expected 2024).</p>

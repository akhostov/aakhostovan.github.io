I"è<p>Host Dark Matter Halo Mass and its correlation with LyŒ± and rest-frame 1500√Ö luminosity <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.489..555K/abstract">Khostovan 2019</a>. These two plots highlight two important key features: 1) correlations are redshift independent when taking into account evolution in line luminosity, 2) bright (high SFR) galaxies tend to reside in higher mass halos, and 3) there is evidence for a transitional halo mass at L &gt; L* where star-forming galaxies become rarer within increasing luminosity. This is also seen for bright UV LyŒ± emitters which are &gt; 50% likely to be AGN at \(M_{UV} &lt; -21\) mag.</p>

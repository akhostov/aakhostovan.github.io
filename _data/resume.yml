  summary: >
    I am from South San Francisco, CA and earned my degrees from the University of California, Irvine (Bachelors in Physics) and University of California, Riverside (Masters and PhD in Physics).
    I was also a NESSF PhD fellow my last 2 years at UC Riverside and went on to be a NASA Postdoctoral Program Fellow at Goddard Space Flight Center as my first postdoc position. I am currently 
    a Postdoctoral Research Associate at RIT. My work primarily focuses on studying galaxy evolution, especially extreme emission line galaxies, using narrowband surveys, spectroscopic follow-ups, and broadband color excess. I am
    interested in studying how star formation activity occured in galaxies, what factors influenced said activity, and map out the evolutionary path to present-day galaxies. My work also involves creating and managing the COSMOS
    spectroscopic archive and spec-$$z$$ compilation. **Below is a brief version of my full CV which can be downloaded by clicking the "Full CV" button.**

      I am leading several projects under the supervision of Jeyhan Kartaltepe involving the development of a large COSMOS spectroscopic archive.
    highlights:
      - "Led development of a large archive of all spectroscopic data taken within COSMOS"
      - "Contributed to the development of Redshift Wrangler, a citizen science program designed for users to help in analyzing reduced data from the COSMOS Spectroscopic Archive."
      - "Main lead on creating and maintaining the COSMOS spec-z compilation of published redshifts (separate from above mentioned archive)."
      - "Leading PI on 2 spectroscopic follow-up programs with Keck and Gemini"

      I led several projects under the supervision of Sangeeta Malhotra and James Rhoads on investigating emission line galaxies with large narrowband surveys. The pivotal moment of this position
      was creating a forward modeling approach in constraining the intrinsic equivalent width distributions of galaxy populations and highlighting how this approach can be used to infer the relative
      contribution of high EW emitters to total cosmic star formation activity at any constrained redshift. 
    highlights:
      - "Led studies on emission line galaxies selected from the narrowband LAGER survey"
      - "Worked on creating clean & reliable samples of Hα, [Oiii], and [Oii] emitters"
      - "Used statistical modeling (e.g., MCMC) to investigate luminosity functions of samples"
      - "Developed a statistical, forward modeling approach to study the intrinsic equivalent widths of star-forming galaxies"
      - "Developed a method predicting number count predictions for *Roman* and *Euclid* based on constraints from stellar mass functions and intrinsic H&alpha; equivalent width evolution"

      I led projects that made up the core of my PhD thesis studying emission line galaxies using wide narrowband and intermediate-band surveys targeting H&alpha;, [OIII], [OII], and Ly&alpha; emitters from $$ z \sim 0.4$$ to $$\sim 6$$.
    highlights:
      - "Led studies on emission line galaxies selected via several narrowband surveys"
      - "Investigated statistical properties of star-forming galaxies up to z ∼ 6"
      - "Used machine learning approaches to study galaxy-galaxy clustering and galaxy-halo connection"
